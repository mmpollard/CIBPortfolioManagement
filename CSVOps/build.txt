First, the user must make sure to have python and pandas installed:

Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Pandas can be installed a number of ways. One of the easiest is to install anaconda (http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) and subsequently call "conda install pandas" from the command line. Other possible installations can be explored here: 
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

In order to run the file (quandl.py), run from the command line:
python ~/path_to_file/tradestatistics.py ~/path_to_input_file/input_filename.csv

If you've moved your files in to your working directory, simply run:
python quandl.py input_filename.py

Your output file will be written to a file called output.csv in your working directory.
